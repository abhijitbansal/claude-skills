## test-board ✕ and session-compass's `tests` segment (PR #35, 2026-10-11)

Pressing `✕` hides the test-board band but leaves `test-board.latest`
intact, so session-compass's band and pane keep showing `tests N ✓ M ✗` until
the runs expire at 60 minutes (expiry prunes `latest`, so both clear then).

- **A (default, shipped):** `✕` hides the test-board band only. Compass keeps
  the counts until the hour is up. Matches PR #35's stated intent.
- **B:** `✕` also empties `latest`, so compass's segment clears at once. One
  meaning of "closed" everywhere, but closing the band also drops the counts
  from the compass line.
- **C:** compass reads `test-board.dismissed` and hides its segment while the
  newest run is dismissed. Keeps both, at the cost of compass knowing a second
  test-board state key.
